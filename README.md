# Drupal update_sh

This is a basic template of an update script we use nowerdays for updating all
parts of the Drupal installation after a code update has made in the repository.
It is used on the local environment and the integration, test and live site to
ensure different tasks have been executed.

## Tasks

Tasks may be any deployment related stuff Drupal needs to ensure the site is
rolled out correctly and exactly behaves like intended.
